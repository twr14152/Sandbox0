Summary:
- Use bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin) 
	When you need more control over the input:
   - reading a specific number of bytes
   - handling binary data
   - More complex parsing requirements

- Use bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin) 
	- when you want to read input line by line
  - When you want to split the input into simple tokens
  - More straightforward and convenient approach to get input.

Choose the one that best fits your needs.
