The time package in go does not provide a method to return millisecond. To get that divide "(nanosecs/1 million) = msec"
The time values within individual fields can get retrieved using the following Methods:
  - Hour()
  - Minute()
  - Second()
  - Nanosecond()
  
 There are also 3 more Methods:
  - Clock() - hr, min, sec with in a day
  - Unix() - number of secs that have passed since epock 1/1/1970
  - UnixNano() - number of nanosec that have passed since epoch 1/1/1970
  
  Single hr/min/sec times are not returned with a leading 0.... By default!
